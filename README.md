# Spring Boot Microservices Portfolio

Welcome to my Spring Boot Microservices portfolio! This repository contains my learning projects and demos covering Java fundamentals, Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Microservices architecture, Docker, and Kubernetes.

## Repository Structure

- `01-java-foundation/` - Core Java concepts: OOP, Streams, Lambdas, Collections deep dive.
- `02-spring-framework/` - Spring Framework fundamentals: Dependency Injection, Spring MVC CRUD.
- `03-springboot-projects/` - Sample Spring Boot projects including Blog App, To-Do REST API, JWT security demo.
- `04-microservices-architecture/` - Microservices examples: Question Service, Quiz Service, Eureka Server, API Gateway, with Docker Compose.
- `05-docker-kubernetes/` - Containerization and orchestration samples: Dockerfiles, Kubernetes YAML manifests, Helm charts.

## Why This Portfolio?

This repo demonstrates my progression in mastering backend development using Java and Spring technologies. It reflects my understanding of:

- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java
- Spring Framework core features and MVC pattern
- Building RESTful APIs with Spring Boot
- Securing applications with JWT and Spring Security
- Designing and implementing Microservices with service discovery, API gateways, and load balancing
- Containerizing applications using Docker
- Deploying and managing microservices on Kubernetes clusters

## How to Use This Repository

- Browse individual folders for project code and documentation.
- Clone and run projects locally using provided instructions.
- Use this as a reference to understand how I approach backend development and microservices architecture.

## Future Plans

- Add more advanced microservices examples using event-driven design.
- Integrate CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions.
- Include monitoring and logging with Prometheus and ELK stack.
